# DSR.Architecture.Domain

![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Dsr.Architecture.Domain?style=flat-square)

Core domain library for the DSR.Architecture solution. This project contains the essential building blocks for domain-driven design, including entities, value objects, domain events, and business logic abstractions. It is designed to be modular and scalable, serving as the foundation for enterprise applications built with DSR.Architecture.

## Features

- **Entities**: Core domain objects with identity and lifecycle management.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing descriptive aspects of the domain.
- **Domain Events**: Events that capture significant occurrences within the domain.
- **Business Logic Abstractions**: Interfaces and base classes for implementing domain logic.

## Usage

Add this package as a dependency to other projects in the DSR.Architecture solution to share domain models and logic.

## Installation

You can install the NuGet package once published:

```bash
dotnet add package DSR.Architecture.Domain
```
